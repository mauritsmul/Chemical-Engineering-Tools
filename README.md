Welcome to my chemical engineering toolbox!

In this repository I share my scripts which I used for chemical engineering purposes in university.
Please feel free to contribute to the projects I made during my time as a student.
Over the course of time I'd like to expand this toolbox so people can become better chemical engineers and learn from the mistakes I made along the way!

Note that all the code which is supplied in this toolbox will be OpenSource, meaning that everyone, anywhere can use this code as they'd like.

Happy learning!
